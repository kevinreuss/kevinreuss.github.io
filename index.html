							<h4><b>Kyub: a 3D Editor for Modeling Laser-Cut Objects (4 months)</b></h4>
							<br>
							<h4>
								Kyub is an interactive editing system for laser cutting that allows users to create models efficiently in 3D, which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems, such as FlatFitFab, kyub affords construction based on closed box structures, which allows users to turn very thin material, such as 4mm plywood, into objects capable of withstanding large forces, such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction, every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint “boxel”—a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically, resulting in larger, yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor, boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb’s various geometry deformation tools.
								<br>
								I was responsible for building the reinforcement functionality.

							<h4><b>FormFab: Towards Shape Exploration in Interactive Fabrication (6 months)</b></h4>
							<br>
							<h4>
								Several systems have illustrated the concept of interactive fabrication, i.e. rather than working through a digital editor, users make edits directly on the physical workpiece. However, so far the interaction has been limited to turn-taking, i.e., users first perform a command and then the system responds with physical feedback. In this paper, we present a first step towards interactive fabrication that changes the workpiece while the user is manipulating it.
								FormFab reshapes the workpiece while users are moving their hands. This enables users to interactively explore different sizes of a shape with a single interaction.
								<br>
								I was responsible for building the robotic control system.

							<h4><b>Integrating Electronic Components into Deformable Objects Based on User Interaction Data.  (4 months)</b></h4>
							<br>
							<h4>
								A key challenge when designing deformable user interfaces is the integration of rigid electronic components with the soft deformable device. In this paper, we propose to place electronic components based on how the user is interacting with the device, i.e., in which way the device is being deformed when the user performs gestures. 

								To identify optimum locations for placing electronic components, we developed a design tool that takes as input a 3D model of the deformable device and a set of captured user gestures. It then visualizes the stress distribution resulting from the gestures applied to the deformable device and suggests where not to place components because the location is highly deformed when users interact (e.g., a rigid battery that would constraint interaction); or alternatively where to place components to sense deformation more accurately (e.g., a bend sensor to detect a specific gesture) and efficiently (e.g., an energy harvesting component). 

								We evaluated our approach by collecting interaction data from 12 users across three deformable devices (a watch, a camera, and a mouse) and applied the resulting stress distributions to the placement of selected electronic components.
								<br>
								I built the whole IT-System for this project.

							<h4><b>Using 3D Printing and Actuation to Adapt Physical Tools to Facilitate Motor Skills Learning (2 months)</b></h4>
							<br>
							<h4>
								Many  motor  skillsthat  people  learn  throughout  their  livesinvolve  mastering  a  physical  tool,  such  as  riding  a  bike, writing  with  a  pen,  or  playing  basketball. To reduce  the level of difficulty,learners usephysical learning aids, such as training wheels for a bike,that provide physical support.To date, these learning aids only come in predefined levels:For  instance, trainingwheels  are  either  mounted  or  taken off.Thisjumpfrombeginnertoexpert levelmakes  the transitiondifficult for learners.In  this  paper,  we address  this  challengebyadaptingthe physical toolaccording  to  the  learner’s  progress. For  in-stance, whilelearning  to ride  a  bike,  we monitor learners’balancing  skills  and as  they  improve,  wegraduallyliftthe trainingwheels to reducesupport and increase the difficul-ty.Thus,ourapproachenablesa  step-by-step transition from beginner to expert levelthat, similar to existing adap-tive  learning  systems  for  math  and  language  skills,is  per-sonalized foreach individual learner. Toillustrate  our idea,  we  builtan  end-to-end  systemthat allows  designers  to  setup adaptable tools  that physically changewhen  alearner’s  skill level increases.Our  system uses sensorsintegrated  with  the  toolsto  measure  progress; parametric  3D  modelingto  adapt  thetool;and  then either actuationor refabricationtodeploy the physical change.

							<h4><b>LinePod - A portable, interactive platform for the blind (9 months)</b></h4>
							<br>
							<h4>
								Together with 4 fellow students and under supervision of <a href="http://www.patrickbaudisch.com/" class="class1">Prof. Dr. Patrick Baudisch</a> and <a href="http://oliverschneider.ca/" class="class1">Dr. Oliver Schneider</a> I build this platform as part of my bachelor project. My task was to build the hardware.
                                The system consists of a modified knife cutter, a finger tracking device called Airbar and a common Android smartphone. We replaced the knife in the knife cutter with a 2W laser for precisely heating up so-called swell paper. This paper swells up in areas that get heated up and thus can produce tactile lines, feelable for blind people. Because the paper is always in contact with the cutter, we can easily pull it in to extend the content. To allow interaction we use an Airbar device for touch input and the smartphones voice input and output for communication to the device.
                                In addition, we build a Framework to allow other developers to build apps for our platform and wrote a bunch of apps like a Calendar and an App to find an apartment.
